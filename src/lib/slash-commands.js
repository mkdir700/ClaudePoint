5. Explain what hooks will do:
   - Create automatic safety checkpoints before bulk file operations
   - Only enabled triggers will be active (by default: before_bulk_edit)
   - User can manage with \`claudepoint hooks status\` and \`claudepoint hooks configure\`

IMPORTANT: Always check status first before running init-hooks to avoid duplicate setup.
